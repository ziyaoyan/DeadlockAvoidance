Ziyao Yan and Natalie Rubin's CISC361 Project

Describe your design approach and the output of your program for the test inputs provided to you.

Our code doesn't completely run so we were unable to get output for out program. However, we can describe the design approach behind this program. 

Our project consists of a main function that creates an InputParser. The InputParser reads in all of the information from the file containing the commands. It then determines which command is being called and calls functions that complete necessary tasks.

It parses the commands and then completes actions based on the code.
